<div id="paragraph">Science is three blind people stumbling across an elephant. One touches its side and thinks it is a wall, the second touches its leg and thinks it is a tree, and the third touches its trunk and thinks it is a snake. The three compare their data, and the first two scientists argue over whether the elephant is a giraffe or a rhino while the third is riducled for suggesting they have walked into someone's front yard where a snake is in a tree planted right near their house.</div>
